# python-day-9
-Today i learned if, elif, and else in python
-and also match case that are new in python 
1)For if i create simple program
age=54
if(age>18):
    print("you can drive")
    print("Thank you")
-That help us to know which person age is fit in driving criteria

2)if_else
in this statement i create same age driving criteria system but with else statement

age=int(input("enter your age:"))
if(age>18):
    print("you can drive:")
else:
    print("you cannot drive")
print("End of program")
-Here i ask enter your age if he enter greater then 18 age
He can drive the car
but else if he smaller than 18 He cant drive....

3)if_elif_else
In this statement i create 3 projects                      #here i ask user enter your age 

(1)=# age=int(input("Enter your age:"))                   if his age is  grater than 18 he can drive
# if(age>18):                                             if his age is =18 we ask for lets schedule a interview                                                           
#     print("you can drive:")                             
# elif(age==18):
#     print("lets schedule a intrview:")
# elif(age==0):
#     print("Hey,you are just born:")
# else:
#     print("You cannot drive:")

                                                                                                          #Here i ask a ussr to enter a marls 
(2)# marks=int(input("Enter your marks:"))                                                                if his marks is grater than 80 he got "A"grade nad if the marks is grater than 60 he got "b" grade and if 
# if(marks>80):                                                                                           the marks is grater than 35 he got "c" grade                           
#     print("you get \"A\"grade")                                                                         
# elif(marks>60):
#     print("you get \"B\" grade")
# elif(marks>35):
#     print("You get\"c\"grade")
# elif(marks==35):
#     print("You get\"c\"grade")
# else:
#     print("you are fail")
